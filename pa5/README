PROGRAM DESCRIPTION --------------------------

This is a game that has animals in it. The animals can move, fight, sleep,
die, eat, and mate. Each animal has specific behaviors. The game is run
on a field that has animals running around and food on the ground. When
an animal of the same species meet, they will mate. Animals can randomly
fall alseep as well after eating. When an animal is mating or sleeping, any other animal
will kill it. When an animal fights, it can Scratch, Pounce, or Roar.
Roar beats Scratch, Scratch beats Pounce, and Pounce beats Roar. If
both animals use the same attacking move, then one of them randomly wins.

The bear can be a grizzly (brown) or polar (white) bear. The bear always moves
southeast, is always hungry, and when a fight occurs, will always scratch,
and is represented by a 'B'.

The Lion moves clockwise, is red, represented by 'L', and always attacks with
Roar against a bear and Pounce otherwise. The Lion will is only hungry after
fighting. Once if has eaten, it is no longer hungry until another fight occurs.

The Tiger is yellow, represented by a random non-negative integer, and moves 
3 steps in a random direction. The Tiger has a hunger level and is shown
in the game by the integer. If the integer is positive, then the Tiger
is hungry. Everytime the Tiger eats, the hunger level decreases by 1 and
is updated in the game. When the Tiger is hungry, it will always Scratch
in a fight, otherwise it will Pounce.
