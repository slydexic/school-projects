SHORT RESPONSE ---------------------------

1. Suppose Desktop/f1/f2/f3 is your working directory. Let fubar.java be
   in the Desktop. To copy fubar.java to f3, you type:
   'cp ~/Desktop/fubar.java ~/Desktop/f1/f2/f3/fubar.java'

2. 'man cat' prints out the user manual for using the command 'cat',
   which is short for concatenate.
3. Let n be the desired line number. Type ':n' to jump to n.
4. Hitting the 'g' key twice jumps you to the beginning of the file.
   Hitting 'Shift' then 'g' takes you to the beginning of the last line.
5. A constructor must have a name, which is the same name as the class, and
   must also have a visibility statement (public, private,...) .
6. A static variable allows all objects of that class to share
   the static variable.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION -----------------------

The combination of all files make the game 2048. The purpose of this game
is to get the highest score by moving tiles up, down, left or right.
For each direction, all tiles will move as far as possible. A tile stops
if a tile cannot combine with a another tile of same value or if the
tile reaches the end of the board. When a tile combines, the score is
increased by the value of the new tile. The game ends when no tile can
move in any direction. The core classes that are involved in 2048 are
Board.java or GameManager.java . The Board file handles all movement
of tiles, the size of the board, and saving the board. The GameManager
file let's you play the game. It prints out the interface and updates
the game after each move.
