SHORT RESPONSE ------------------------------

1. To test if CSE8B_Line line2 = new CSE8B_Line(line1); is
   a deep copy, change one of the points of line1 and check if
   line2's points are the same as line1 afterwards. If so, then it is a
   shallow copy. Otherwise, it is a deep copy.

2. To check if equals is doing a deep comparison or shallow
   comparison, change one of the points of line1 and apply
   the method afterwards. If true, then the equals method is
   doing a shallow comparison. Otherwise, it is a deep comparison.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION -------------------------------

The program contains classes that represent various shapes and a point.
They all have specific variables for their dimensions and positions.
The program will draw these shapes onto a canvas based on their
variables. They can be filled in shapes or outlines of the shapes.
They can also have colors. The shapes can be moved and redefined.
