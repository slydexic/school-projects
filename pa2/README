PROGRAM DESCRIPTION -------------------

This program consists of two java files, WordCloud.java and WordPair.java.
The WordPair file contains a class to make WordPair objects. WordPair objects
can hold one word and the number of times a word appears in a text file.
The WordCloud file contains the WordCloud class to make WordCloud objects.
The WordCloud object has an ArrayList object that holds the WordPair objects.
Thus you can think of the WordCloud object as an actual "word cloud".
The WordCloud can read a text file and take all the unique words found by
creating WordPair objects and putting them in to the ArrayList.
We can also remove WordPair objects that have words we don't want.
In particular, this WordCloud removes common words such as 'the' or 'a'.
After the WordCloud runs through a file, it can also find and show you
the top number of words that appear in the file. It can also find and show
you the number of times a specific word appears.
