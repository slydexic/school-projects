PROGRAM DESCRIPTION -----------------------

The CS8BTurtle.java file contains a subclass of Turtle. It is a specific
turtle that will draw specific characters. It will draw:

	CS8BEQ
	SPRING
	 2015

with one turtle.

The CS8BTurtle_Threaded.java file is a subclass of Turtle and also
implements the Runnable interface. This allows turtles to draw the
above image simultaneously as opposed to a single turtle. The
interface allows the turtle objects to go through their own
"Threads" which allow them to draw on their own. Each creation
of a Turtle will open up a Thread.
