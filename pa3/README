6. In your working directory, let F be the name of the
   folder you want to delete. If F is non-empty, 
   type 'rm -rf F'. If F is empty, type 'rmdir F'.
   The first command recursively deletes the the contents of F.
   So it deletes the contents at the end of the path directory
   until it reaches F then deletes F. The second command simply deletes F.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION --------------

The Board.java file handles the game board for 2048. The game board can
start out as a brand new board or a board from a saved game. The file
also lets you add random tiles to the board or save the board you are
currently using. The file also checks if any moves are valid on the board
and if the game is over.
The GameManager.java file plays the game for the user. GameManager is the 
interface for the user. It takes input from the user and sends output from
the Board file. So it is like the middleman.
